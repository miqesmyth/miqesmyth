I am a beginner software developer currently working full time at an Amazon fulfilment center. I work in the ship dock department. I've also worked in other departments and indirect paths as well.
I'm currently learning JavaScript through Tech Elevator and everything else inbetween that this specific bootcamp has to offer.
I am looking forward to collaborate to learn, understand different perspectives, and share my own. Humor is encouraged. This is all very, very, very new to me.
I am looking to help wherever I can and learn as much as possible.
Ask me about literally anything you want.
You can reach me at : mindbates@yahoo.com
I am a musician at my core and play video games as a hobby. I dabble in art and photography as well. Arts of a multitude of kinds is where my soul is located.
